# COFFEE-SALES-DASHBOARD
This project is an insightful Coffee Sales Dashboard created using Excel. It provides a comprehensive overview of coffee sales trends over time, allowing you to analyze and visualize sales data effectively.
The dashboard includes a line chart that displays total sales for different coffee roast types (Arabica, Excelsa, Liberia, and Robusta) from 2019 to 2022, enabling you to identify peaks and dips in sales.
Additionally, the dashboard features interactive sliders that allow you to filter sales by roast type (Dark, Light, or Medium) and loyalty card status, providing a granular view of sales based on specific criteria.
The sales breakdown by country and the top 5 customers list offer valuable insights into geographic sales distribution and key customer contributions.
Overall, this Coffee Sales Dashboard is an excellent tool for monitoring sales performance, identifying trends, and making data-driven decisions to optimize sales strategies and operations within the coffee industry.
